Side is a simple (java based) desktop managment app which can help you hold notes of important stuffs from files you're browsing and copying at the same time.
It can also help you keep your desktop clean and sorted by avoiding cluttery organization of icons or files on your main desktop. All you have to do to keep it simple is to drag files you want to access and put them on the side bar which we've made ready ;)
I'll try and post a clear and full instructions on how the app works soon.
